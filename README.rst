The Middle Lands of Keltor is a campaign setting (compatible with famous RPGs released under the `Open Game License`_), created by `William R. Gibson <mailto:will.gbn@gmail.com>`_ on May, 2011.

*Thanks to William for creating this great campaign setting, sharing it with us (in details), and allowing its use under the `Open Game License`_*.

This project is an Open Game Content conversion of the The Middle Lands of Keltor.
A few modifications were required in order to achieve that, such as removing or replacing creatures and names that are not open content.

You can find it in html format `here <https://lukems.github.io/keltor/>`_. A pdf version of the OGC release should be made available soon.

The original Middle Lands of Keltor campaign setting can be found at the William's `rpg stash <http://www.unicornbacon.com/leezard/rpg_listing.html>`_ page, in pdf format, or at `his website <http://www.unicornbacon.com/leezard/rpg_listing.html>`_.
